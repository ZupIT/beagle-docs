## Introduction
This is the library responsible for rendering a Beagle JSON (payload) in Flutter. It is currently in alpha stage, and
most features are yet to be implemented. We welcome any help from the community in making improvements to the API -
which is not yet final - and implementing functionalities that are missing. You can find
[here]({{< ref path="/resources/customization/flutter/development" lang="en" >}}) our current state of development.

## Versioning
Every alpha and beta version of Beagle Flutter will follow the pattern `0.x.y`, where `x` is the version of Beagle Web
it's based on and `y` is every subsequent version where `x` would be the same.

In the version number, `x` refers to a version of the Beagle Web, because Beagle Flutter uses this lib under the hood.

## Compatibility
For now, we're focusing in the most recent version of Flutter (2.2), but before releasing, we'll test it with older
versions to guarantee it also works.

## Installation
1. Open the file `pubspec.yaml` in the root of your project.
2. Under `dependencies`, add `beagle: ^0.0.9`, or whatever the most recent version is.
3. Also add `beagle_components: ^0.0.9`. You can omit this dependency if you're familiar with Beagle and won't use any
of the default components.
4. From your IDE, click `pub get`. Or, from the terminal, type `flutter pub get`.
