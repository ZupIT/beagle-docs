## **Usage**
It's simple to configure and use Beagle's Flutter library, follow the steps below:

### Step 1. Configure Beagle
All the configuration necessary for Beagle to work is centered on the parameters of the `BeagleSdk.init` startup method. These params tell everything Beagle needs to know how to render your widgets. Here you will see only the basic options `baseUrl` and `components`. For a list of all the available options, please check the 
[Beagle Initialization section]({{< ref path="/resources/customization/beagle-for-flutter/configuration" lang="en" >}}).

### Step 2. Start Beagle
You can start Beagle at any point of the application. In this example, we will start Beagle as soon as the app 
starts.
To do that:
- Open the file `lib/main.dart`;
- Import `package:beagle/beagle.dart`;
- If you're using the `beagle_components` package, import `package:beagle_components/beagle_components.dart` as well;
- Inside the main function, before rendering anything, call `BeagleSdk.init` passing the parameter previously informed. 
See the example below:

```dart
import 'package:beagle/beagle.dart';
import 'package:beagle_components/beagle_components.dart';

void main() {
  BeagleSdk.init(
    baseUrl: 'http://yourBffBaseUrl.io',
    components: defaultComponents,
  );
  // runApp();
}
```

### Step 3. Render a remote widget
You must use the component `BeagleWidget` which is provided by the Beagle Library. This widget requires a single parameter, the `screenRequest`, which specifies the request to fetch the first server-driven view of the flow. See the example below:

```dart
import 'package:beagle/beagle.dart';
import 'package:beagle_components/beagle_components.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  BeagleSdk.init(
    baseUrl: 'http://yourBffBaseUrl.io',
    components: defaultComponents,
  );
  runApp(const BeagleSampleApp());
}

class BeagleSampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const BeagleSampleApp({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Beagle Sample',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: BeagleWidget(
          screenRequest: BeagleScreenRequest('welcome'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The example above used a simple Material App to render the server-driven widget. The component `BeagleWidget` includes a remote view in the layout.

The `BeagleWidget` accepts other optional parameters, just like the `BeagleScreenRequest`. If you want to check them, please visit the [BeagleWidget section]({{< ref path="/resources/customization/beagle-for-flutter/beagle-widget" lang="en" >}}).

Congrats, you have finished your first Beagle Screen!
