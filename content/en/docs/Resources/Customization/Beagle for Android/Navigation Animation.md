## Introduction

Beagle has a [**screen navigation**](/docs/resources/screen-navigation) tool that allows you to configure actions like navigate to a new screen or close one. 

Besides these configuration, you can also customize the navigation of your application. 

There are two customization options:

1. According to Android's animation pattern.
2. Fragments transition provided by Beagle, that it can be customized according to your preference and design system. They are: 

* [**PushView**](/docs/api/actions/navigate/pushview)
* [**PopView**](/docs/api/actions/navigate/popview)
* [**PopToView**](/docs/api/actions/navigate/poptoview)

## Protocol and customized 

**Beagle's pattern protocol** for customization is to use a native Android tool, to make fragment transition to customize your animation.

For more information on how this process works, [**check out the Android's section**  **setCustomAnimations**.](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/FragmentTransaction#setCustomAnimations%28int,%20int,%20int,%20int%29)

The other way to customize an animation it is the transition through the [**BeagleActivity**](/docs/get-started/creating-a-project-from-scratch/) class implementation, which Beagle uses the _**getFragmentTransitionAnimation\(\)**_ method.

In case this method it isn't implemented and customized, the transitions will follow Beagle's default animation. The code below shows the [**BeagleActivity**](/docs/get-started/creating-a-project-from-scratch/) method, that can be overwritten this way:

```kotlin
open fun getFragmentTransitionAnimation() = FragmentTransitionAnimation(
    enter =  R.anim.slide_from_right,
    exit = R.anim.none_animation,
    popEnter = R.anim.none_animation,
    popExit = R.anim.slide_to_right
)
```
