### What is it?
What is it?
Presents a new screen and puts it on the pile.

Your structure is represented by the attribute below:

| **Attribute** | **Type**                                       | Required | **Definition**    |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :------- | :---------------- |
| route         | [**Route**](/api/actions/navigate/route/) | âœ“        | Navigation route. |

## How to use it?

On the example below, there is a screen coming from BFF with a button that, when is clicked, opens a new server-drive fragment with a specific BFF screen.

You need an endpoint to return with the code below from you BFF to test it and the frontend will call it. You can pass a local \ or a remote route will pass the endpoint of the screen, which it will be navigate.
