### What is it?

Presents a new screen and puts it on the pile.

Your structure is represented by the attribute below:

| **Attribute** | **Type** | Required | **Definition**    |
| :------------ | :------- | :------- | :---------------- |
| route | [**Route**]({{< ref path="/api/actions/navigate/route/" lang="en" >}}) | âœ“        | Navigation route. |
| controllerId | String |     | The navigation controller id to be used during the navigation action, If missing, the default navigation controller will be used instead. |

## How to use it?

On the example below there's a screen coming from BFF with a button that when clicked, open a new server-driven activity with a screen specified by BFF.

To test, your BFF's endpoint should return a the screen with the code below and call it in the frontend. You can pass a local route or a remote one that will pass the screen endpoint to the one it will navigate.
