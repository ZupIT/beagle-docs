### Getting started
<hr>

**It's recommended for more advanced users of Beagle.**

You can add this as a dependency via CocoaPods.

```
pod 'BeagleDefaults'
```

After adding BeagleDefaults as a dependency in your project, you can use all the default implementations in your _Beagle.dependencies_.

All implementations can be changed up to your preferences, this is only a fast Beagle setup for more advanced Beagle users that does not want to implement non of these configurations to use Beagle.
