To start using Beagle right now, you can use the libs below:
* [Beagle-Scaffold]({{< ref path="/get-started/using-beagle-helpers/ios/beagle-scaffold" lang="en" >}}):
This lib will hold almost all configurations needed to start using Beagle in your project.
We advise using these libs for people that never used Beagle before.

* [Beagle-Defaults]({{< ref path="/get-started/using-beagle-helpers/ios/beagle-defaults" lang="en" >}}):
This lib is meant for more experienced Beagle users and will hold only a few class configurations necessary to use Beagle in an application. These configurations include default Network, Logger and Cache classes. All these are also available in the Scaffold lib above.

If you wish to configure a project with Beagle from scratch use our [**documentation**]({{< ref path="/get-started/creating-a-project-from-scratch/case-ios/" lang="en" >}})
