The Beagle View is the entity responsible to manage a server-driven view. It can be created through the Beagle Service via the function `createBeagleView`. The BeagleView can fetch a new view, update its tree, navigate, etc.

## Accessing the Beagle View

A Beagle View is created in Angular or React when the component `BeagleRemoteView` is used. To get access to it, you should use the property `onCreateBeagleView`, in Angular, or `viewRef` in React.

See the examples below:

### **Angular**

```text
<beagle-remote-view [loadParams]="loadParams" (onCreateBeagleView)="onCreateBeagleView($event)">
beagle-remote-view>
```

```text
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { BeagleView } from '@zup-it/beagle-web'

@Component({
  // ...
})
class MyComponent {
  private beagleView: BeagleView | undefined

  // ...

  logBeagleView() {
    if (!this.beagleView) return
    console.log(this.beagleView))
  }

  onCreateBeagleView(beagleView) {
    this.beagleView = beagleView
    this.logBeagleView()
  }
}
```

### **React**

```text
import React, { useRef, MutableRefObject, useEffect } from 'react'
import { BeagleRemoteView } from '@zup-it/beagle-react'
import { BeagleView } from '@zup-it/beagle-web'

const MyComponent: FC = () => {
  const beagleView = useRef() as MutableRefObject<BeagleView | undefined>

  // ...

  logBeagleView() {
    if (!beagleView.current) return
    console.log(beagleView.current)
  }

  useEffect(logBeagleView, [])

  return <BeagleRemoteView path="/my-path" viewRef={beagleView} />
}
```

In the examples above, you accessed the Beagle View and logged it. It is important to notice that you need to check for the Beagle View availability before using it. Since the Beagle View is created by a child component, it won't be available before the children components are created.

## Fetching a view

To fetch a view from the backend and update the current view, you need to use the method `fetch` of the `BeagleView`.

A fetch operation can be over the entire tree or just a branch. If it's the entire tree, it gets replaced by the result of the request. Otherwise, the tree is kept the same, but for the branch you use `fetch` to update, this specific branch will get replaced by the result of the request. See an example of a call to the function `fetch`:

```text
// fetches the remote view at /my-path and uses it to replace the entire current view
beagleView.fetch({ path: '/my-path' })

// fetches the remote view at /my-lazy-container and uses it to replace the component with id 'lazy'
beagleView.fetch({ path: '/my-lazy-container' }, 'lazy')
```

`fetch` can accept 3 parameters, they are:

1. **loadParams:** required. object containing the parameters to control the request, the options are the following:

- **path**: required. Path to the view in the backend.
- **fallback:** optional. A Beagle Tree to fallback to in case of an error.
- **method:** optional. `get` by default. Use this option if you need another http method.
- **headers:** optional. Use this option to pass additional headers to this single request.
- **shouldShowLoading:** optional. Tells wether to use or not the loadingComponent while the view loads. Will use the global configuration if not specified.
- **shouldShowError:** optional. Tells wether or not to show the error component if the request fails. Will use the global configuration if not specified.
- **strategy:** optional. Tells which [**cache strategy**](/resources/customization/beagle-for-web/cache-strategy) should be used to load this specific view. Will use the global configuration if not specified.
- **loadingComponent:** optional. The loading component to use. Will use the global configuration if not specified.
- **errorComponent:** optional. The error component to use. Will use the global configuration if not specified.

  2. **anchor:** optional. Id of the node to attach the resulting view to. By default, it uses the root node and it uses to update a single branch.

  3. **mode:** optional. How to attach the resulting view to the anchor, there are four modes:

- `replaceComponent`: default. Replaces the entire anchor with the result of the request.
- `replace`: replaces the children of the anchor with the result of the request.
- `prepend`: adds the result of the request at the start of the list of children of the anchor.
- `append`: adds the result of the request at the end of the list of children of the anchor.

## Subscribing to events

You can subscribe to events in the Beagle View. There are two types of subscriptions, one that listens to every update to the tree \(`beagleView.subscribe`\) and another that listens to every error in the fetch/renderization process \(`beagleView.addErrorListener`\).

When calling `beagleView.subscribe`, you must pass a single parameter, which is a function that receives the current rendered tree. See the example below:

```text
const unsubscribeLogger = beagleView.subscribe((newTree) => {
  console.log('The tree was updated!')
  console.log(newTree)
})
```

To remove a listener, just call the function it returned. In the previous example `unsubscribeLogger()`.

Error listeners are registered in a similar way. The only difference is that they receive a list of errors:

```text
const removeErrorListener = beagleView.addErrorListener((errors) => {
  console.log('Oops! An error just happened!')
  console.log(errors)
})
```

By default, Beagle logs every error in the fetch/rendering process to the console. Once a custom error listener is added to the Beagle View, Beagle will stop logging errors by itself and use the treatment provided by the developer instead.

## Destroying the Beagle View

To avoid memory leaks, Beagle View must be destroyed if it won't be used again. If you're using Angular or React, there's no need to worry about it, it will get done under the hood. If you're using Beagle Web directly, you must call `beagleView.destroy()` when the remote view is removed from the page.

## API
