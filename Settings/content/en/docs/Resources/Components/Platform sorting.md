  Here you'll find about Beagle's functionality to filter what elements are sent
  to which platform
---

---

Some elements provided by Beagle can be better used in some platforms than other, for example, [**ScrollView**](/docs/api/components/layout/scrollview) works better in mobile and it is not needed for web. 

Beagle has a platform specification functionality, so it is able to control which elements are sent by BFF and which platforms will be used. 

### How does it work? 

Beagle uses a customized header `beagle-platform` with the possible values: 

* `ALL`;
* `MOBILE`;
* `ANDROID`;
* `IOS`;
* `WEB`;

This way, the BFF response is intercepted according to the platform which it is being sent. 

### How can you access it? 

There are two way you can access this control: 

1. Through **flow control structure** in your code that verifies which platform your client used to make a request: 

```kotlin
fun createComponentPlatformDependent(beaglePlatform: BeaglePlatform) = when {
    this.beaglePlatform.isMobilePlatform() -> {
        ScrollView(
            children = listOf(
                Text("Mobile platform")
            )
        )
    }
    this.beaglePlatform == BeaglePlatform.WEB -> {
        Text("Web platform")
    }
    else -> {
        ScrollView(
            children = listOf(
                Text("Mobile platform"),
                Text("Web platform")
            )
        )
    }
}
```

 2. You can **specify which platform** the element will use and then Beagle will filter the correct elements: 

```kotlin
Button(text = "mobile only text").forPlatform(BeaglePlatform.MOBILE),
Button(text = "web only text").forPlatform(BeaglePlatform.WEB),
Button(text = "ios only text").forPlatform(BeaglePlatform.IOS),
Button(text = "android only text").forPlatform(BeaglePlatform.ANDROID),
Button(text = "text free for all")
```

You can check [**how to configure this functionality, see Beagle customization section**](/docs/resources/customization/beagle-for-backend).

If you use Beagle starters, it is not necessary to configure this functionality manually, because it is already configured.
