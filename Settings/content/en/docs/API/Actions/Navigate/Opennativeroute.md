## How to use it?

The example below, we have a screen coming from BFF with a button when you click, opens a native screen. 

To test is, just configure [**Deep Link Handler**](../../../resources/customization/beagle-for-android/deep-link-handler) for Android or **openNativeRoute** for iOS. Besides, your BFF's endpoint must return the code screen below and call it in the frontend. 

{{< tabs id="T92" >}}
{{% tab name="JSON" %}}
```javascript
{
  "_beagleComponent_" : "beagle:screenComponent",
  "child" : {
    "_beagleComponent_" : "beagle:button",
    "text" : "Click me!",
    "onPress" : [ {
      "_beagleAction_" : "beagle:openNativeRoute",
      "route" : "my-native",
      "shouldResetApplication" : false
    } ]
  }
}
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="Kotlin DSL" %}}
```kotlin
Screen(
    child = Button(
        text = "Click me!",
        onPress = listOf(
            Navigate.OpenNativeRoute(
                route = "my-native"
            )
