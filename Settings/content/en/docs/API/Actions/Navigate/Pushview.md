### What it is?

Presents a new screen and puts it on the pile.

Your structure is represented by the attribute below: 

| **Attribute** | **Type** | Required | **Definition** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| route | [**Route**](/docs/api/actions/navigate/route/) |          âœ“ | Navigation route. |

##  How to use it?

On the example below, there is a screen coming from BFF with a button when clicked, open a new  server-drive fragment with a specific BFF screen. 

To test is, you need a endpoint to return with the code below from your BFF and call it in the frontend. You can pass a local route \(that it will pass a screen in the route\) or remote route that will pass the endpoint of the screen which it will navigate.
