### What is it?

Presents a new screen and puts it on the pile.

Your structure is represented by the attribute below: 

| **Attribute** | **Type** | Required | **Definition** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| route | [**Route**](route/) |         âœ“ | Navigation route. |

## How to use it?

On the example below there's a screen coming from BFF with a button that when clicked, open a new server-driven activity with a screen specified by BFF.

To test, your BFF's endpoint should return a the screen with the code below and call it in the frontend. You can pass a local route or a remote one that will pass the screen endpoint to the one it will navigate.
