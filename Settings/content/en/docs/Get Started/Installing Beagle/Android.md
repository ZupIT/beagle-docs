## Requirements

Before you start to configure Beagle for your Android system, it's important to check out if you have installed all the current versions of the following programs:  â€Œ

* **JDK 8 language**
* **Android API level: at least 19 or higher**
* **Kotlin 1.3+** 

## **Step 1: Dependencies' configuration** 

You have to adjust your repository's dependencies to receive Beagle. To do so, use the following configurations to **download library.** 


```kotlin
// Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        // < 1.1.0
        maven {
            url 'https://dl.bintray.com/zupit/repo'
        }
        // >= 1.1.0
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

The above configuration must be added to`allprojects{}`
{{% /alert %}}

## **Step 2: Include plugins**

Once you made the first configuration, now you have to include the kapt and Beagle's plugin as dependencies on your dependency manager. 

The current release version of Beagle is[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/br.com.zup.beagle/android)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/br.com.zup.beagle/android)




```kotlin
// Add in your plugins
apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'â€‹

android {
    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}

// Add in your app level dependency
ext.beagle_version = "${beagle_version}" 

dependencies {    
    implementation "br.com.zup.beagle:android:$beagle_version"    
    kapt "br.com.zup.beagle:android-processor:$beagle_version"
```


Insert the Beagle's release version on the place of`${beagle.version}`, in other words, put the Beagle's version highlighted in blue badge above without the **v character**.

For example: undefined-`ext.beagle.version = "0.2.8"`

Remember to always check if you're using the latest version of Beagle. To see this information, you just have to pass your mouse above the version number. After that, sync your machine.

## Next Steps 

On this section, you made Beagle's **initial installation** on your application!  
To keep configuring Beagle:

ðŸ‘‰Go to[ **initial configurations**](../using-beagle/android) to enable the use of Beagle on your Android project.
